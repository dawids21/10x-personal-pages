# App - Personal Pages

## Main Problem

Being present online is becoming more important than ever. People should have a simple way to create a personal page
describing their knowledge and experience without the need for deep technical expertise, such as setting up hosting,
domain registration, and writing frontend code. Personal Pages will allow users to import a document with all the
necessary information, and will then generate a personalized page with an easy-to-remember link using a chosen theme.

## Minimum Functionality

- Account creation to administer the personal page.
- Changing the theme of the personal page (two themes available).
- Downloading a YAML document (template or currently configured).
- Importing a YAML document for the main page.
- Importing additional YAML documents for project subpages.
- Changing the URL of the personal page (example link: `https://personalpages.com/page/USER_PAGE`).

## What's Outside the Scope?

- Custom themes.
- Adding and managing pictures or screenshots from projects.
- Setting up custom domains (e.g., forwarding `https://customdomain.com` to `https://personalpages.com/page/USER_PAGE`).
- Advanced tools for managing page SEO.

## Success Criteria

- 80% of users have successfully set up their personal page.
- 80% of users have at least one project subpage.
