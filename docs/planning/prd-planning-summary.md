<decisions>

1. **Target Audience**: Two primary personas - students (showcasing university experience and personal projects for
   hiring) and freelancers (demonstrating expertise and project details to future employers)

2. **MVP Scope - YAML Only**: YAML importing will be the only option for MVP; no visual form-based editor will be
   provided

3. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth will handle all authentication needs

4. **No Preview Mode**: MVP will feature real-time updates only - when users import new YAML, changes are immediately
   visible on the live page

5. **Analytics Approach**: Success metrics will be measured through logs stored in database; no analytics dashboard or
   user-facing statistics in MVP

6. **URL Management**: No restrictions on URL change frequency; no redirects from old URLs after changes (old URLs
   simply stop working)

7. **Monetization**: No monetization strategy; all features will be free

8. **Timeline**: Quick MVP project targeting 2-3 weeks development time

9. **User Support**: YAML validation with UI feedback showing missing/incorrect elements; template provided but no
   onboarding process, help center, or tutorials

10. **YAML Structure**:
    - Main YAML: Required fields (name, bio); Optional fields (skills, experience with job title and description,
      education with school name and description, contact info with phone and links)
    - Project YAML: Required fields (name, description); Optional fields (tech stack, integrations, link to production
      version, start/end date)

11. **Character Limits**:
    - Main YAML: name (100), bio (500), job title (100), job description (500), school name (100), school description (
      300), contact info (200)
    - Project YAML: name (100), description (500), tech stack (500), integrations (500)

12. **Project Linking**: Array of clickable project names in main page leading to subpages defined in separate project
    YAML files

13. **Themes**: Two themes for MVP, but they will not be very different; detailed theme design deferred to later

14. **Success Metric Definition**: Successfully set up page = published page with required data present (name + bio); no
    content quality checking

15. **URL Rules**: 3-30 characters, alphanumeric plus hyphens, lowercase, no consecutive hyphens, can't start/end with
    hyphen, reserved words blocked (admin, api, auth, help, about); uniqueness checking occurs after confirmation (not
    real-time)

16. **Concurrency Handling**: No locking required as users only modify their own pages; confirmation dialog needed
    before changes

17. **Account Deletion**: Immediate deletion of user page and data upon account deletion; no data export button (users
    can download YAML during normal usage)

</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>

1. **Define clear user personas** - Implemented: Two personas identified (students and freelancers) with specific needs
   and use cases

2. **Define clear limits for MVP to manage infrastructure costs** - Implemented: Comprehensive character limits defined
   for all YAML elements to prevent walls of text

3. **Simple, secure authentication foundation** - Implemented: Using Supabase Auth for out-of-the-box authentication

4. **Build analytics from day one** - Implemented: Logging system for tracking setup completion and project subpage
   creation

5. **URL change management** - Partially implemented: URL rules defined but no redirects or rate limiting in MVP (
   simplified approach)

6. **Structure development in clear phases** - Implemented: 2-3 week MVP with minimum functionality, clear scope
   boundaries

7. **Comprehensive YAML validation with user-friendly error messages** - Implemented: UI feedback showing which elements
   are missing, not recognized, or violate length constraints

8. **Define YAML schema with required and optional fields** - Implemented: Clear structure for both main page and
   project subpages

9. **URL format rules and reserved words** - Implemented: Specific rules for URL format and system-level reserved words

10. **Confirmation dialog for immediate changes** - Implemented: Confirmation required before publishing changes to live
    page

## Key User Stories

### Student Persona

1. As a student, I want to create a personal page showcasing my university projects so that I can increase my chances of
   getting hired
2. As a student, I want to add multiple project subpages so that I can demonstrate my technical skills and experience
3. As a student, I want to choose a modern theme so that my page looks professional

### Freelancer Persona

1. As a freelancer, I want to showcase my expertise and project portfolio so that I can attract future clients/employers
2. As a freelancer, I want to detail my role in each project so that potential clients understand my capabilities
3. As a freelancer, I want an easy-to-remember URL so that I can share my page on business cards and social media

### Common User Paths

**First-Time Setup:**

1. User creates account via Supabase Auth
2. User downloads main page YAML template
3. User fills out template with personal information
4. User imports YAML (system validates and shows errors if any)
5. User selects custom URL
6. User chooses theme
7. Page goes live immediately at `https://personalpages.com/page/USER_PAGE`

**Adding Project:**

1. User downloads project YAML template
2. User fills out project details
3. User imports project YAML
4. System validates and adds project to clickable list on main page
5. Project subpage is immediately accessible

**Updating Content:**

1. User downloads current YAML configuration
2. User modifies YAML locally
3. User imports updated YAML
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. User confirms, changes go live immediately

## Success Criteria & Measurement

### Primary Metrics (from logs in database)

1. **80% Setup Completion Rate**: Percentage of registered users who successfully publish a page with required fields (
   name + bio) populated
2. **80% Project Subpage Adoption**: Percentage of users who create at least one project subpage

### Tracking Implementation

- Log account creation events
- Log successful main page YAML imports with required fields
- Log project subpage creation events
- Log URL customization events
- Log theme change events
- No user-facing analytics dashboard in MVP

### Definition of Success

A "successfully set up" page is defined as:

- Account created
- Valid main YAML imported
- Required fields present (name + bio)
- Page publicly accessible at chosen URL

Content quality is not evaluated; only presence of required fields matters.

## User Experience Considerations

### Onboarding

- Minimal onboarding - no tutorials or help center in MVP
- Users rely on YAML template structure with field names as guidance
- System provides immediate validation feedback

### Error Handling

- Clear, specific validation errors shown in UI
- Errors indicate: missing required fields, unrecognized fields, length violations (too long/short)
- No inline help or suggestions beyond error messages

### Content Constraints

- Character limits enforced to prevent walls of text
- Promotes concise, scannable content
- Limits support fast page load times

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Custom theme creation or customization
- Image/screenshot uploads and management
- Custom domain forwarding
- Advanced SEO tools
- Preview mode before publishing
- Version history or rollback capability
- URL redirects after URL changes
- User-facing analytics or page view statistics
- Data export functionality (beyond standard YAML downloads)
- Onboarding tutorials or help documentation
- Real-time URL availability checking
- Account recovery grace period (deletion is immediate)
- Social login options
- Two-factor authentication

<unresolved_issues>

1. **Project URL Slug Generation**: The mechanism for generating `PROJECT_SLUG` from project YAML is not explicitly
   defined - should it be derived from project name, user-specified, or auto-generated?

2. **Theme Names and Characteristics**: The two themes are planned but not yet designed or named - this needs definition
   before development

3. **Clickable Project Array Ordering**: No specification for how projects should be ordered in the clickable list (
   chronological by creation, by date fields in YAML, user-defined order, alphabetical)

4. **YAML Format Specifics**: While field names and limits are defined, the exact YAML syntax/structure conventions (
   e.g., how arrays are formatted, date format requirements, URL validation for links) need documentation

5. **Reserved URL Words**: "admin, api, auth, help, about, etc." - the complete list of reserved words should be
   documented

6. **Error Recovery**: No specification for what happens if a user imports invalid YAML multiple times - are there any
   rate limits or protections against repeated failed imports?

7. **Contact Info Structure**: Contact info is defined as 200 chars including "phone and links" but the exact
   structure (is it free text? structured fields?) is ambiguous

8. **Skills Array Format**: Skills are mentioned as optional but no limit on number of skills or individual skill name
   length is specified

9. **Multi-language Support**: No mention of whether content can be in multiple languages or if there are character
   encoding considerations beyond English
