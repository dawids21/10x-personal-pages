<decisions>

1. **Target Audience**: The primary target users are developers who want to create a personal page to find their first
   or a new job.
2. **Authentication**: User authentication will be implemented using Supabase Auth.
3. **YAML Guidance & Validation**: The YAML template will contain comments to guide users. There will be no separate
   documentation. The system will validate uploaded files for required fields and structure, providing field-level error
   messages (e.g., "'bio' is a required field but was not found") without line numbers.
4. **Project Management**: Projects are managed as separate YAML documents. They are not defined within the main YAML
   file but are added through a user dashboard.
5. **Project Display**: The main personal page will automatically query the database for associated projects and display
   them.
6. **URL Changes**: When a user changes their personal page URL, the old link will become inactive and lead to a 404
   page.
7. **Content Updates**: For the MVP, updating page content is done by overwriting the existing YAML file with a new
   upload. No version history will be stored.
8. **Theming**: The two available themes will differ only in their color schemes.
9. **Schema Design**: The MVP YAML schema will not include any fields for images (e.g., `image_url`) to maintain
   simplicity.
10. **Business Model & Goal**: The project will be free forever. The primary goal is to provide an interesting and
    useful tool to the developer community.
11. **Success Metric Definition 1**: "Successful setup" is defined as a user uploading their first main YAML file
    without validation errors. It will be measured via a specific SQL query.
12. **Success Metric Definition 2**: The goal for project subpages will be measured by "the percentage of users who have
    successfully set up a main page AND have also uploaded at least one valid project YAML."
    </decisions>

<matched_recommendations>

1. **Audience Targeting**: The recommendation to narrow the target audience to "tech-savvy professionals" (developers)
   aligns with the final decision.
2. **Error Handling**: The recommendation for a validator that provides specific, user-friendly error messages was
   adopted, with the clarification that errors will be field-specific rather than line-specific.
3. **User Dashboard**: The recommendation to design a simple dashboard for managing the main page and project YAMLs was
   confirmed as the intended approach.
4. **URL Change Consequence**: The recommendation to make it clear that old links will become inactive (404) was
   confirmed as the chosen behavior.
5. **Success Metric Definition**: The recommendations to precisely define both success criteria ("successful setup"
   and "at least one project subpage") as specific, trackable events were accepted.
6. **Update Mechanism**: The recommendation to use a simple file-overwrite mechanism for updates in the MVP was
   confirmed.
7. **Project Vision**: The recommendation to clearly define a non-financial, strategic goal aligns with the decision
   that the project will be a free tool for the community.

<prd_planning_summary>
This document summarizes the planning for the "Personal Pages" MVP, a tool for developers to create simple personal
portfolio pages from YAML files.

**a. Main Functional Requirements**

* **Account Management**: Users must be able to create and manage an account using Supabase Auth.
* **Page Generation**: The core functionality is the generation of a personal page by importing a user-provided YAML
  document.
* **Project Subpages**: Users can add separate project subpages by uploading additional YAML documents through a
  dedicated interface. The main page must automatically list these projects.
* **Page Administration**: Authenticated users must have access to a dashboard to:
    * Upload/update their main page YAML.
    * Upload/manage project YAML files.
    * Change their personal page URL (e.g., `{APP_DOMAIN}/page/{USER_URL}`).
    * Switch between two available color-based themes.
* **YAML Processing**: The system must provide a commented YAML template for users to download. It must also validate
  uploaded files for structural integrity and required fields, providing clear error feedback to the user upon failure.

**b. Key User Stories and Usage Paths**

* **As a developer looking for a job, I want to quickly create a clean, professional-looking personal page by filling
  out a simple text file, so I can showcase my experience without dealing with hosting or web development.**
* **As a user, I want to add multiple projects to my page by uploading separate files, so I can keep my main profile
  concise while offering deep-dives into my work.**
* **As a user, I want to update the content on my page by simply re-uploading a modified file, so I can easily keep my
  information current.**
* **As a user, I want to choose a simple color theme and a custom URL, so I can personalize my page slightly.**

**c. Important Success Criteria and Measurement**

* **Primary Goal (Adoption)**: 90% of users successfully set up their personal page.
    * **Measurement**: Track the number of unique users who upload their first valid main YAML file.
* **Secondary Goal (Engagement)**: 80% of users have at least one project subpage.
    * **Measurement**: Calculate the percentage of users with a successful main page setup who have also uploaded at
      least one valid project YAML file.

<unresolved_issues>
The following points have been explicitly deferred and require decisions before or during the development process:

1. The specific authentication providers to be enabled via Supabase Auth (e.g., GitHub, Email/Password).
2. The detailed UI/UX design and layout of the user administration dashboard.
3. The definitive schema (list of required and optional fields) for the main and project YAML templates.
4. The user-facing confirmation and warning mechanism for when a page URL is changed.
5. The long-term strategy for introducing future schema changes (like adding image support) that would require users to
   update their YAML files.
