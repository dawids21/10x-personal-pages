1. The landing page for unauthenticated users will display the app name and a login form.
2. After their first login, new users will be directed to an initial page creation form containing inputs for the page
   URL, theme, and an optional data field. This form will also include an option to download a template for the main
   page.
3. Once a user creates their page, they will be presented with the main admin dashboard.
4. The dashboard will show inputs and controls for the page URL, theme, YAML data (upload/download), and projects.
5. Public-facing pages will be rendered via Astro's server-side rendering (e.g., `[url].astro`), which will fetch the
   necessary data.
6. The application will render the initial page form if a `GET /api/pages` request returns a 404 status; otherwise, it
   will display the full dashboard.
7. All successful create, update, or delete actions will trigger a toast notification (e.g., 'Page saved', 'Project
   created').
8. The dashboard will display the user's public page link directly under the URL input field.
9. Project reordering will be handled using up/down arrows in the UI, with a dedicated "Save Order" button to submit the
   changes in a single API call.
10. State management for API loading and error states will be handled within individual components using local state (
    `useState`), not in a global React Context.
11. React Context will be used only for state that is explicitly shared between multiple components, otherwise local
    state will be used.
12. The project list on the dashboard will not use a separate page or form for editing. All actions (rename,
    upload/download YAML, reorder, delete) will be managed directly from the list view.

<matched_recommendations>

1. **Dashboard Structure**: The dashboard will be organized into distinct sections using card components for "Page
   Settings," "Page Content," and "Projects."
2. **YAML Content Management**: The UI will not include an in-app YAML editor. Instead, it will provide "Download
   Current YAML" and "Upload New YAML" buttons, enforcing an offline editing workflow.
3. **Project List UI**: Projects will be displayed in a list, with each item containing controls for reordering (up/down
   arrows), renaming the project, uploading/downloading the project's YAML, and deleting the project.
4. **State Synchronization**: Functions that perform API mutations will be responsible for explicitly refetching data
   upon success to update the application's state.
5. **New Project Creation**: A modal will be used to create new projects. Upon successful submission, the modal will
   close, the project list will be updated, and a success toast will be shown.
6. **Error Handling for YAML**: The UI will display a detailed list of field-level validation errors returned from the
   API when a YAML upload fails.
7. **Feedback for Processing**: During YAML file uploads, the UI will show a loading indicator and disable the upload
   button to provide clear feedback to the user.

<ui_architecture_planning_summary>

The UI architecture for the Personal Pages MVP will be centered around a main admin dashboard built with Astro and
interactive React components.

**Key Views and User Flows:**

- **Unauthenticated Flow**: A minimal landing page will present the application name and a login form.
- **First-Time User Flow**: Upon first login, the user is guided to create their main page via a dedicated form. The
  `GET /api/pages` endpoint returning a 404 will trigger the display of this form.
- **Authenticated Flow**: Once a page exists, the user will be directed to the main dashboard. The dashboard will be the
  central hub for all management tasks and will be structured with cards for "Page Settings," "Page Content," and "
  Projects."
- **Public Page View**: Public pages will be rendered server-side by Astro, ensuring fast load times and good SEO.

**API Integration and State Management:**

- **State Management**: The primary state management strategy will rely on local component state (`useState`). React
  Context will be used sparingly, only for state that needs to be shared across components. Component-level state will
  handle `isLoading` and `error` states for API calls.
- **API Interaction**: The frontend will interact with the REST API as defined in the `api-plan.md`.
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications will be used to confirm the success of all CRUD operations (create, update,
  delete). Loading states will be clearly indicated with spinners and disabled buttons during server-side processing
  like YAML validation.
- **Data Synchronization**: After successful API mutations, components will manually refetch data to ensure the UI is
  synchronized with the backend.

**Component Design and Interactions:**

- **Project Management**: Project reordering will be facilitated by up/down arrows, with a "Save Order" button to
  persist the changes atomically. All project management (rename, data upload/download, delete) will occur inline within
  the project list, without navigating to a separate view.
- **YAML Handling**: The UI will strictly enforce an offline editing policy for YAML files by only providing upload and
  download functionality. Validation errors from the API will be displayed clearly to the user.

**Security:**

- All endpoints for the dashboard require authentication, which will be handled by Supabase Auth and verified by Astro
  middleware. Authorization is enforced by Supabase RLS policies.
