1. Authentication scope: Email + password only; no OAuth or magic links.
2. Email verification: Required for new users; redirect URLs to be defined in technical specs.
3. Public vs protected routes: Public = “/” (landing/auth), “/page/*” (personal and project pages); all other views and APIs protected.
4. Auth UX location: All auth flows (sign-in, sign-up, forgot password) embedded on “/” using tabs; “Forgot your password?” reveals reset UI.
5. Post-verification redirect: Users go directly to the dashboard.
6. YAML template access: Available only to authenticated users (no public template download).
7. Navigation: No login button in public header; logout button visible on dashboard header.
8. Account deletion: Self-serve button on dashboard; public pages become immediately unavailable upon deletion.
9. Support and localization: No support channel; English-only for MVP.
10. Accessibility: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA for auth flows.
11. Additional auth methods: No plans for more methods.
12. Success metrics for auth feature: None defined; global product metrics remain in PRD.
13. User stories: Will be defined for this feature (beyond those already present in the PRD).
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
1. Limit MVP to email/password via Supabase Auth (accepted).
2. Require email verification before accessing authenticated views/APIs (accepted).
3. Consolidate all auth flows on the landing page “/” using tabs/sections (accepted).
4. Show an interstitial “Check your email” confirmation after sign-up (accepted).
5. Keep all authoring actions (upload, manage, template download) behind authentication (accepted).
6. Provide immediate removal of public visibility upon account deletion with a clear confirmation step (accepted).
7. Exclude admin/backoffice capabilities from MVP (accepted).
8. Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility for auth flows (accepted).
9. English-only copy and emails for MVP; structure for future localization (accepted).
10. No expansion to OAuth for MVP; document as out of scope (accepted).

<prd_planning_summary>
a. Main functional requirements:
- Users can register, verify email, sign in, sign out, and reset password using email + password via Supabase Auth.
- All authenticated features (dashboard, YAML uploads/updates, project management, template downloads) are protected; only “/” and “/page/*” are public.
- Authentication UX is embedded on the landing page “/” via tabs for sign-in, sign-up, and forgot password; no login button in public header; logout is available in dashboard header.
- After email verification, users are directed to the dashboard. A “check your email” interstitial is shown after sign-up.
- Users can delete their accounts from the dashboard; public pages become immediately inaccessible after deletion.
- English-only UI for MVP; auth flows must satisfy WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility principles.

b. Key user stories and usage paths:
- Sign-up and verification: From “/”, users open the Sign Up tab, submit form, see “check your email,” verify, and are redirected to dashboard.
- Sign-in: From “/”, users sign in and are taken to the dashboard.
- Forgot password: From “/”, users click “Forgot your password?” and complete the reset within the same page; upon success they can sign in.
- Logout: From dashboard header, users log out and return to the public landing page.
- Account deletion: From dashboard, users confirm deletion; public pages become unavailable immediately.
- Content management: Once authenticated, users upload YAML for main page and projects, manage slug and theme, and view public pages at “/page/*”.

c. Important success criteria and measurement:
- No dedicated success metrics for the auth feature beyond global PRD metrics.

d. Unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification:
- Redirect URLs post-auth events (verification, reset) to be defined in technical specifications.
- Technical details (session persistence, cookie settings, security policies, email template configurations, rate limiting) deferred to technical specifications.
  </prd_planning_summary>

<unresolved_issues>
- Define exact redirect URLs for verification and password reset in technical specs.
- Specify session persistence, cookie policies, and other security parameters in technical specs.
- Finalize email templates and sender configuration in technical specs.
- Draft detailed user stories for password reset and account deletion flows.
